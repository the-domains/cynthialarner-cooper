Who am I? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b1f3cab2-d881-482c-ac26-9dd8f59f1b46.jpg)

I was born Cynthia Jane Larner in 1962 so I'm officially a 'baby boomer' from Tasmania, Australia. 

My mother (pictured on the right with my Aunty Nancy) is Adrianna (nee Knoop) from Holland and my father is Roger Maxwell Larner, born in Tasmania. 

We first lived at Geeveston south of Hobart, then moved with Dad's forestry job to National Park in the Derwent Valley. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/496290d5-c192-4b92-aa83-e21879e7a2aa.jpg)

I have a younger brother (Malcolm Larner) and a younger sister (Rosanne Thompson) who both have 2 children. I have none. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/efaa7d53-a751-447e-8a74-c5f340b44787.jpg)

My Oma and Opa, Anna and Lambert Knoop, emigrated from Holland in 1951 and lived until they were 92 and 93\. 

My Gran and Pop, Nita and Maxwell Larner, passed away when I was much younger. They lived in Lindisfarne near Hobart. 

I went to school at Westerway primary then to New Norfolk High School followed by Elizabeth College in Hobart where I was a boarder. 

Between the age of 16 and 18 I lived on our farm at Port Arthur on the Tasman Peninsula, working as a shop assistant, waitress and then as a teacher aide and community help for the elderly. 

I started the Tasman Horse Riders Club and also worked with our horses taking trail riders from our Semaphore Farm during the summers. 

My love of photography saw me enrol as a student in art school for 1 year then I spent the next few years as an Equine Photographer and writer for horse magazines such as Rider, Hoofs & Horns and the Arabian Horse News.
